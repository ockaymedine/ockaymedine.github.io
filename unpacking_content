      "One of the best ASMR like games out there. Pleasant story, it's nice to see the evolution of the character through the years and how life change, new relationships, new goals and milestones.\n\nA lot of easter eggs and little interactions you can do in the game, from Zelda Game Cube games to Donnie Darko DVD, at first glance seems a very simple and straightforward games, and it's, but with you look closer, you can found a lot of good stuff hidden in there"

      "Unpacking honestly helped me calm down and drive down memory lane, but in some levels it's really annoying that the game has its own idea of how and where to put stuff. You should wait for a sale, then it's definitely worth it"

      "This game is so relaxing and fun to sit back and enjoy. 10/10 HIGHLY RECOMMEND!! I just wish it was longer :( Hopefully in the future there will be many DLC's (for example luxury person, a grocery person, different cultures, gardener, etc.) This game has so much potential for extra added game play, or open up Steam Workshop for the community to make a bunch of extra content, so this game will be unlimited game play. Now that I finished the game in under 5 hours i'm so sad because I want more"
